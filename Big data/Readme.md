This was part of the techgig code gladiator semi-final round Big data contest

I was part of the team named 'Let's teach the machine' along with Rajesh Vaswani as the team member

The theme was figuring out the fradulent ad clicks. The problem statement was to create a machine learning model to predict the fraudulent ad clicks.

The data shared included the users activity with respest to ad clicks and other information like the location, user agent, click time etc.

We built a gradient boosting model which gave us 10th place in the leaderboard when the competition concluded.
